# Real Time Loss Tools

Tools for the assessment of earthquake damage and loss in real-time, developed within the
[RISE project](http://rise-eu.org/home/).

The Real-Time Loss Tools carry out rapid loss assessments (RLA) and event-based operational
earthquake loss forecasts (OELF) incorporating probabilities of damage states based on
structural health monitoring (SHM) methods, calculating cumulative damage, expected economic
losses and human casualties (injuries and deaths) and updating the number of occupants in the
buildings, by taking into account the time of the day of the earthquake as well as whether
people are allowed back (due to inspection and repair times) and are able to do so (due to their
own health status). The tools recursively call the
[OpenQuake engine](https://github.com/gem/oq-engine) and update the exposure model and other
relevant input files.

These tools are not an operational deployment but a research tool made openly available to the
community.

## Installation

It is recommended that a Python 3.8 virtual environment be created so as to install and run the
software from within it. To do so, type:

```bash
$ python3.8 -m venv YourPreferredName
```

`YourPreferredName` will be the name of the virtual environment. Activate it by doing:

```bash
$ source YourPreferredName/bin/activate
```

Before doing anything else, upgrade `pip` to its latest version (not doing so might result in
errors during installation that will not indicate that the problem lies in the version of
`pip`):

```bash
(YourPreferredName) $ pip install --upgrade pip
```

Move within your directory structure to a location where you would like to clone the present
repository. From there, do:

```bash
(YourPreferredName) $ git clone https://git.gfz-potsdam.de/cnievas/real-time-loss-tools.git
(YourPreferredName) $ cd real-time-loss-tools
(YourPreferredName) $ pip3 install -e .
```

The last command will install the `Real Time Loss Tools` and all its dependencies, including the
[OpenQuake engine](https://github.com/gem/oq-engine). If you already have a version of OpenQuake
installed in your computer, even if it is within a virtual environment, the different versions
or installations will share the same underlying database and it might be necessary to stop and
re-start it to be able to run the `Real Time Loss Tools`. The error that might flag up if this
is the case might not be fully self-explanatory, and so it is recommended to stop and re-start
the database as a precautionary measure by doing:

```bash
(YourPreferredName) $ oq dbserver stop
(YourPreferredName) $ oq dbserver start
```

Please note that mixing different versions of OpenQuake can lead to the database becoming
unusable with older versions.

The virtual environment can be deactivated by typing:

```bash
(YourPreferredName) $ deactivate
```

### Software dependencies

- Python 3.8 or above (tested only with Python 3.8 and 3.9)

### Python libraries

- `pyyaml`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `shapely`
- `pyproj`
- `rtree`
- `geopandas`
- `pytz`
- `openquake.engine 3.15`

## Documentation

For scientific documentation, please see [Citation](#citation) down below.

Software documentation: click [here](docs/README.md).

## Running

### Preparation

A series of [input files](docs/03_Input.md) and a specific
[file structure](docs/03_Input.md#assumed-file-structure) are needed to run the
`Real Time Loss Tools`. Please click on the corresponding links for details and follow the
instructions.

Once the input files and the file structure have been created, create a `config.yml` file
following the example contained in this repository as
[config_example.yml](./config_example.yml) and the corresponding
[documentation](docs/02_Configuration.md). The `config.yml` file can be located anywhere, but
the `Real Time Loss Tools` need to be run from the directory where `config.yml` is located. It
can be placed, for example, within `main_path`.

### Execution

Having activated the virtual environment where the `Real Time Loss Tools` are installed,
navigate to the directory where you placed `config.yml`. Then type:

```bash
(YourPreferredName) $ rtlt
```

The program will start to run.

### Example files

A full set of example input and output files can be found
[here](https://git.gfz-potsdam.de/real-time-loss-tools/rise-d6-1-data-files). These are the
input files used for a proof of concept developed as part of Task 6.1 of the
[RISE project](http://rise-eu.org/home/), as well as the associated main outputs.
