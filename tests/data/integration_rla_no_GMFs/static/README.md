# Notes

1. `site_model.csv`: Average shear-wave velocities in the top 30 metres (Vs30) based on the
model of Weatherill et al. (2022), interpolated using inverse distance weighting as explained in
Nievas et al. (2023).
2. `recovery_injuries.csv`, `recovery_damage.csv`, `gmpe_logic_tree.xml`,
`exposure_vulnerability_mapping_state_dependent.csv`, `consequences_injuries_severity_X.csv`,
`consequences_economic.csv` based on / extracted from Nievas et al. (2023).
3. `fragility_model.xml` contains state-dependent fragility models derived by Orlacchio (2022),
as well as fragility models of a monitored building modelled by Yves Reuland as part of the work
presented in Nievas et al. (2023).
